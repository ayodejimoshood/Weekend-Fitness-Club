# Weekend-Fitness-Club
WFC

# Summary - The Weekend Fitness Club (WFC) requires software to manage bookings of group fitness lessons made by customers. The club offers different fitness lessons on both Saturdays and Sundays with different prices. Each lesson can accommodate up to 5 customers, and there are 2 lessons per day on each weekend. Customers can view the timetable either by specifying the day or the fitness type. Customers can book as many lessons as they want but no duplicate booking is allowed, and they can change or cancel a booking provided that there are still spaces available. After each lesson, customers can write a review and provide a rating ranging from 1 to 5. The software must print reports containing the number of customers per lesson on each of the 8 days, along with the average rating of each lesson and the type of fitness lessons which generated the highest income. The deliverable includes designing 8 weekends of timetable covering at least 4 different types of fitness lessons with specified prices, and the final program should be self-contained without the need for an external database or security protocol.
